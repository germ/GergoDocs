Mislabeled Silk, C6 is 0.1uF, R1 is 2.2k

![](img/18.png)

Another silk mistake, C5 is 0.1uF

![](img/20.png)

22 = 22R0

![](img/21.png)

103 = 10K

![](img/23.png)

222 = 2.2K

Close up of the osc traces, notice the connection

![](img/25.png)

Oscilator whacked in properly

![](img/3.png)

TRRS/USB solder, notice the amount on the TRRS, you want as much as possible on there!

![](img/24.png)

Proper placement

![](img/26.png)

Position of the circle on the silks for the IO

Flux gunk before and after cleaning with alcohol

![](img/31.png)

A beautiful MCU job. Notice the spaces.

Trackball PCB so you don't need to squint

![](img/37.png)

Properly soldered leg on Trackball PCB

![](img/38.png)

10K Resistors properly attached.
